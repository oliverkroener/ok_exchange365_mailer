# Exchange365 Mailer extension

Extension for Typo3 to enable mails with Exchange 365 without enabling SMTP by using the MS-Graph API.

## **Enabling Microsoft Exchange 365 Mail Integration for TYPO3 Without SMTP**

### **Seamless Email Integration Using Microsoft Graph API**

Integrating Microsoft Exchange 365 mail services with TYPO3, a widely used content management system, can present challenges, particularly for those looking to avoid the traditional SMTP protocol. A specialized TYPO3 extension now offers a solution by enabling seamless email integration with Exchange 365 without the need for SMTP. This extension utilizes the Microsoft Graph API to send emails directly, providing a secure and efficient method for organizations that prefer not to use SMTP and wish to leverage the modern API-driven capabilities of Microsoft 365.

### **Enhanced Security Through OAuth 2.0 and API-Based Communication**

At the core of this extension's functionality is the use of OAuth 2.0 authentication in conjunction with the Microsoft Graph API to send emails. This method, recommended by Microsoft, provides a secure token-based approach, eliminating the need to store SMTP credentials within the TYPO3 environment. By using Microsoft Graph API to send emails, the extension ensures that communication with Exchange 365 servers is conducted securely and in compliance with data protection standards. This approach is especially beneficial in sectors like healthcare, finance, and government, where data security and regulatory compliance are crucial.

### **User-Friendly Setup with Direct API Integration**

The TYPO3 extension is designed to be user-friendly and straightforward, allowing administrators to configure and manage the email integration directly from the TYPO3 backend. Through an intuitive interface, users can set up the necessary OAuth 2.0 credentials and permissions required for the Microsoft Graph API, which handles the sending of emails. The extension provides detailed documentation and setup wizards to guide users through the entire process, from registering the application in Azure AD to configuring the TYPO3 backend, making it accessible even for those with limited technical expertise.

### **Improved Performance by Bypassing SMTP Overheads**

By sending emails via the Microsoft Graph API instead of relying on SMTP, this extension helps improve overall performance and reduces latency in email communication. The API-based approach allows for direct communication with Exchange 365 servers, bypassing the traditional SMTP handshaking and authentication processes, which can often lead to delays. This results in faster email delivery and a more responsive TYPO3 environment, which is particularly advantageous for websites or organizations with high volumes of email traffic.

### **Cost-Effective, Scalable, and Future-Proof Solution**

This TYPO3 extension offers a cost-effective and scalable solution for businesses by utilizing the Microsoft Graph API to handle email sending. It removes the need for SMTP server setup and maintenance, reducing infrastructure costs. Additionally, the extension's reliance on Microsoft Graph API makes it inherently scalable, capable of handling significant email traffic without requiring additional resources. This future-proof approach aligns with Microsoft's push towards API-driven services, ensuring that businesses can leverage the latest technologies and remain adaptable to future changes in the Microsoft ecosystem.
