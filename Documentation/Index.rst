A TYPO3 extension for sending emails via Microsoft Exchange 365 using the
MS Graph API instead of SMTP. Uses OAuth 2.0 client credentials flow for
secure, token-based authentication.

..  attention::
    Since **Q3 2025**, Microsoft has enforced stricter access policies in *some* Exchange 365 tenants. You may need to configure an **Application Access Policy** to restrict app permissions to specific mailboxes. See :ref:`Exchange Online Setup <exchange-setup>`.

    This can also be used to restrict sending to *only* specific sender addresses (e.g., a **shared mailbox**).
